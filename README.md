# Smart Healthcare Framework for Type 2 Diabetes Prediction

Welcome to the Smart Healthcare Framework for Type 2 Diabetes Prediction project! The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning-based framework to predict the likelihood of an individual developing type 2 diabetes using various risk factors. The framework will help to enable early intervention and better management of the disease.

## Project Scope

The project involves collecting and analyzing data on various risk factors such as Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes pedigree function function, and age, which can be used to predict the likelihood of an individual developing type 2 diabetes. The framework will use machine learning algorithms to learn from the collected data and predict the likelihood of diabetes for a given individual.

The project will involve the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Data on various risk factors will be collected from multiple sources and analyzed.
2. Data Pre-processing: Data will be cleaned, normalized, and pre-processed to remove any outliers or inconsistencies.
3. Machine Learning Model Development: Different machine learning algorithms will be developed and trained on the pre-processed data to predict diabetes.
4. Integration with Existing Healthcare Systems: The framework will be integrated into existing healthcare systems to enable easy access and use.

## Installation

To use the Smart Healthcare Framework for Type 2 Diabetes Prediction, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the main script using the command `python main.py`.

## Usage

The Smart Healthcare Framework for Type 2 Diabetes Prediction provides a command-line interface for easy usage. The main script `main.py` accepts input data in the form of a CSV file and returns the predicted likelihood of diabetes for each individual in the file. The output is also in the form of a CSV file.

## Conclusion

The Smart Healthcare Framework for Type 2 Diabetes Prediction is an essential tool for healthcare providers, researchers, and individuals to predict the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. The project is still ongoing, and we welcome contributions, feedback, and suggestions from the community to improve the framework's performance and usability.
